Implementation time is the time it took for the first pass implementation. Then,
after completing the puzzle, I do a second pass to optimize execution time.

## Day 1

| Part | Implementation Time | Execution Time |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| 1 | 43m | 27.101 µs |
| 2 | 15m | 29.103 µs |

## Day 2

| Part | Implementation Time | Execution Time |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| 1 | 39m | 7.0149 ms |
| 2 | 9m | 13.941 ms |
