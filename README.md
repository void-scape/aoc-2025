Implementation time is the time it took for the first pass implementation. Then,
after completing the puzzle, I do a second pass to optimize execution time.

## Day 1

| Part | Implementation Time | Execution Time |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| 1 | 43m | 45.777 µs |
| 2 | 15m | 223.90 µs |
